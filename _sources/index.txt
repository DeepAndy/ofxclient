The *ofxclient* project provides you with a way to download financial statements from banks that support the :term:`OFX` specification.  

End-users are provided a command line utility so that you can:

- find and configure your banks
- download bank statements for import into financial applications

Developers can also leverage the :py:mod:`ofxclient` module to build their own suite of tools that interact with banks. It makes it easy to:

- configure and store bank account info securely
- download statements
- get account balance
- test bank credentials
